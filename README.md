# JS Fundamentals III - To-Do List

## Fundamentals To-Do List

This project will evaluate your ability to implement a JavaScript driven to-do list. The goal of this workshop is not to finish quickly, but rather to do the best you can so we can gauge where everyone in the class is at and how well you're absorbing the material. Take your time and don't stress out!

### In this Workshop, you will be:

- Using git to create and manage a repository
- Implementing a to-do list based on requirements
- Utilizing HTML to provide structure for the webpage
- Utilizing JavaScript to make the page dynamic
- Utilizing CSS to style the page
- Submitting the project:
- Submit a link to your repository below.
- Project Instructions
- For this webpage you will be implementing a to-do list application. Provided are the setup instructions, requirements, and a list of stretch goals to be - completed if time allows.

### Requirements
In this application you will create a to-do list application that can do the following:
- Users should be able to view all of the to-do tasks
- Users should be able to add a to-do to the list of to-do tasks
- Users should be able to remove to-do's, this could be either deletion or crossing out
- The page should be aesthetically pleasing (aka be styled)
For now do not worry that your page resets during a refresh, making that work is a stretch goal.

If you don't know where to begin, here's the recommended path:

1. Start by adding the HTML code. This is like the skeleton of the page, so add a title, list, form, input, buttons, etc...
2. Add your JavaScript
- Create a variable that will hold your to-do list items.
- Add a function that takes in a string as input and adds it to the to-do list.
- Add an event handler to populate an HTML element with your to-do list when the user clicks the appropriate button.
- Etc... break down the big problems into baby steps and solve them systematically. Test as you go.
3. With the main functionality in place, style your HTML elements using CSS. Make use of the developer console for testing styling.
4. Finished with the main objectives? Continue on to the stretch goals to make your application even better.

### Stretch goals
- Add some instructions to your README.md file around what your application is, how to run it, and how to use it.
- Make the list persist through a refresh of the page by using local storage to store to-do's
- Archive completed tasks in a viewable location on screen
